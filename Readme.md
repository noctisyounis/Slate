The goal of Slate is to serve as a base and a tool allowing you to fasten your workflow. Slate is designed to be easily extensible and adjustable to your needs.
It's based on ImGui to have an adaptative UI. The integration is made on Unity 6000.0.58f1 in URP.

The core idea of Slate is to display a borderless window that will serve as a container for all our custom ImGui windows. Those different tools will then write onto Json files to keep persistant data for the developer.
